  <p>Pigeon Town is a photoblog about pigeons — around the city and elsewhere. Just pictures of pigeons I come across, because they're everywhere and nobody's really paying attention.</p>

  <p>All photos taken by me. You can find more on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/blackavar21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flickr</a>.</p>
